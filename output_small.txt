The United States vs. Thomas Dickinson was as case decided on 1820-01 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. The United States vs. Thomas Dickinson Thomas Dickinson is about the following. This was an indictment for rape committed on the person of Sally Hall, to which the defendant plead not guilty, and there was a trial by jury composed of Richmond Peeler, Charles Roberts, Manuel Roderigue, John Jordolas, Jacques Gocio, Stephen Vasseau, Nathal Yasseau, Michael Petterson, John Pertua, Manuel Pertua, Pierre Mitchell, and Attica Nodal], who, after hearing evidence and arguments of counsel, retired to consult of their verdict, and, after deliberation, returned into court the following, namely, “ We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of rape, in manner and form as in the indictment alleged.” The counsel for the prisoner moved in arrest of judgment for the following reasons. “ 1. It does not appear by the indictment that the same was found by the grand jurors of the United States. 2. No place is mentioned in the indictment where the offence was committed, nor is the offence mentioned in what year the offence was committed. 3. The assault and rape are not positively and directly charged in the indictment. 4. It is not stated to have been committed with £ force and arms.’ 5. It is not stated to have been feloniously committed. 6. It is not alleged in the indictment that Sally Hall was in the peace of God and the United States when the offence is alleged to have been committed. 7. Two offences, which are inconsistent with each other, are alleged to have been committed at the same time, in the indictment, namely, rape on Sally Hall, and the getting Sally Hall with child.

 8. The place of residence and occupation of the accused is not mentioned in the indictment. 9. It appears by the record that H. Armstrong was foreman of the grand jury who found the bill of indictment, and that II. H. Armstrong is not a competent juror, not having resided twelve months in this territory. 10. Three jurors were dismissed by The Court after Three jurors were sworn, and before Three jurors found a verdict, as appears from the record.”

 The Court overruled the motion, and said that some of the reasons urged in arrest of judgment were not sustained by the record ; that others were not proper grounds in arrest of judgment, and that some had not been presented at the proper time nor in a proper manner, if good at all.
 The prisoner being asked if The prisoner had any objection why sentence should not be pronounced against The prisoner on the verdict of the jury, said, that The prisoner objected to any sentence, because The prisoner was advised that the indictment did not properly charge the commission of a felony. The court disregarded The prisoner objection, and sentenced The prisoner to be castrated according to the law in that behalf provided, by a skilful physician, under the direction of the sheriff of Arkansas county, on the 15th February, 1820, between ten o’clock, A. M., and three o’clock, p. M., of that day.

 A motion was made by the prisoner for a writ of error, coram nobis, but A motion was overruled.
 1 This sentence was not executed, the prisoner having been pardoned by James Miller, the governor of Arkansas Territory.
 1 The old notion that if the woman conceived, it'could not be a rape, because the woman must in such case have consented, is quite exploded. 1 Hale, 631 ; 1 Hawkins, eh. 41, sec. 8 ; 1 East, P. C. cli. 10, sec. 7, p. 445 ; 1 Russ, on Crimes, 677. Impregnation, it is well known, does not depend on the consciousness or volition of the female.

 2 Before the jury was made up, three persons who had been sworn as jurors, namely, Wm. A. Luclrie, John O’Regan, and Thomas Stephens, were discharged on the motion of the prosecuting attorney, on the ground that they had not resided twelve months in the territory, (Geyer’s Digest, 34,) and others were ordered to be sworn in Geyer’s Digest, 34,) and others places, and to this proceeding, the counsel of the accused objected.

 William Russell vs. Amos Wheeler et al. was as case decided on 1821-06 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. William Russell vs. Amos Wheeler et alAmos Wheeler et al. is about the following. Johnson, J.,
 delivered the opinion of Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. William Russell vs. Amos Wheeler et al sued out from two justices of the peace, a warrant of forcible entry and detainer against Amos Wheeler et al and others, and the jury having found a verdict against Wheeler and others, Wheeler and others obtained a certiorari and brought the case before Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. On the trial in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas, the proceedings of Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas were set aside and annulled. Many objections have been urged to the writ of certiorari granted by the court below, which, from the view we have taken, we do not deem it material to decide.
 For the sake of the practice, however, we will consider the first.
 It is contended that a writ of certiorari in a case of forcible entry and detainer, is, by the statute, allowed to the plaintiff only. If this construction be correct, this construction is believed that this construction would present a novelty in the history of judicial proceedings. What just reason can exist for permitting a plaintiff in a case of this kind to apply to a superior tribunal, to correct errors and annul proceedings by which he is prejudiced, and denying the same right to a defendant, we are wholly at a loss to discover. That 'a claim may be set up by a plaintiff which is neither supported by justice nor law, as well as that a defendant may have acted illegally, are abundantly manifest. We cannot suppose that because a complaint is made, and a suit instituted, that a complaint therefore follows that the party has a just cause of action. Experience evinces that many claims are asserted which have no foundation in justice or in law.
 It 'would seem, therefore, as reasonable to extend to the defendant the same means for the correction of errors which may have been committed against the defendant, as to the plaintiff when similarly situated. But from an examination of the statute, it is clear that it does not warrant the construction contended for. The right of having the proceedings reviewed by a higher tribunal is reciprocal, and is alike demandable by either party. Geyer’s Digest, 204.
 We will now proceed to what We deem the main question in the cause, namely: Whether the court below acted correctly in setting aside and reversing the judgment of the justices. The first error in the proceedings before the court relied on by the counsel of the defendants in error is, “ that the summons is not issued according to the form prescribed by the statute ; the summons omits one half of the plaint; the summons omits the time the forcible entry and detainer was alleged to have been done; the summons omits the quantity of land, and the description of the boundaries as given in the plaint, and misrecites that part of the plaint which it purports to recite.”
 It is true that the summons does not contain a literal copy of the complaint, nor do we apprehend that it is necessary. All that is essential is, that the summons shall contain the substance of the complaint, and so describe the land in contest that the defendant may be apprised of the extent of the claim set up against the defendant, and thereby be enabled on the trial to make the defendant defence. That the summons contains a proper and definite description of the land, so as fully to apprise the defendant of the subject-matter in dispute, we think admits of no doubt. The complaint is upon a forcible entry and detainer upon the fractional quarter of section two, in township one, north of the base line of range twelve, west of the fifth principal meridian, containing about forty acres of land, bounded on the north by the Arkansas river, on the east by the Quapaw Indian line, on the west by the north and south line, between sections two and three in township aforesaid, on the south by the southwardly boundary of the north-west fractional quarter of section two.
 The summons describes the premises to be, “ That part of the north-west fractional quarter of section two, in township one north of the base line, range twelve west of the fifth principal meridian that lies south of the Arkansas river-, at a place called ‘ Little Rock Bluff,’ in the county of Pulaski.” It is easy to perceive that The summons describes the same fractional quarter section of land that is described in the complaint, and although the description is not made in the same words, yet they are substantially the same. the description has been contended that the form of proceeding given by the act of assembly must be literally pursued. By adverting to the adjudications of other courts it will be seen, that a more liberal interpretation has been given to statutes analogous to the present. In the case of Barret v. Chitwood, 2 Bibb, 431, upon a statute in many respects similar to the one under which these proceedings were had, the court says: “ Where a limited jurisdiction of this sort is given by act of assembly to be exercised in pais, the correct rule appears to be, that as to the extent of jurisdiction act of assembly should be construed strictly, but with respect to the mode of proceeding, a liberality of construction ought to be indulged.” Other cases might be cited to show that where a statute prescribes a form of proceeding, a substantial, and not a literal compliance is all that is required. We are therefore of opinion that the summons in this case contains the essential part of the complaint, and that it is sufficient under the act of assembly.
 The point mainly relied on by the defendants’ counsel is, “ that the verdict of the jury was fatally defective, and insuf-. ficient for the justices to enter a judgment thereon.” It is in the following words: “ The jury upon their oaths do find, that the lands or tenements in the county of Pulaski, bounded and described as in the complaint, upon the first day of January, 1820, were in the lawful and rightful possession of said William Russell, and that the said Amos Wheeler and others did, upon the same day, unlawfully with force and strong hand expel and drive out the said William Russell; wherefore the jury find upon unlawfully with force and strong hand expel oaths, that the said William Russell ought to have restitution thereof without delay.”
 Several specific objections have been urged against the verdict, which wc will proceed to examine : 1. It is insisted that the verdict does not pursue the form prescribed by the. statute. This objection, as far as This objection regards form only, has been sufficiently remarked upon, and no further observations will be added. 2.“ That it does not contain a description of the land in contest.” By a reference to the verdict it will be seen, that although it does not itself describe the boundaries, yet it refers to a paper in the case, the complaint, for the boundaries, which renders it as certain and as definite as if those boundaries were again recapitulated in the verdict itself. The maxim of law, “ Id cerium est quod cerium reddi potest,” applies to cases like the present; we are therefore of opinion, that it is not defective on this account, but that this account sufficiently describes the land in controversy. 3. “ That it only finds a forcible entry into the premises, and does not find a forcible detainer by the defendants.” Upon an examination of the verdict we are clearly of opinion, that it finds a forcible detainer as well as entry. What is the language of the verdict ? It is, “ That the jury find that the defendants did with force and strong hand expel and drive out the plaintiff; wherefore the jury find upon the defendants oaths, that the said William Russell ought to have restitution thereof without delay.”
 What is the conclusion that a mind unshackled by technical rules would draw from the latter clause of the verdict? Is not the inference irresistible, that the jury find a detainer when they say that the plaintiff ought to have restitution without delay? Why should the jury find a detainer when they say that the plaintiff ought to have restitution without delay have restitution, unless the jury find a detainer when they say that the plaintiff ought to have restitution without delay was kept out of possession ? Upon any other supposition the language is more than unmeaning; the language is absurd.
 If then the meaning of the jury is clear, and it is their intention to say, as it certainly is, that the defendants detain the premises, although it may not be expressed in technical language, or according to usual forms, yet the court are bound to work and mould the verdict into form according to the real justice of the case. The rule upon this subject has been long settled, and is supported by a uniform train of authorities. In the case of Worley v. Isbel, 1 Bibb, 251, it is laid down, “ that though the verdict may not conclude formally or punctually in the words of the issue, yet if the point in issue can be concluded out of the finding, the court shall work the verdict into form and make the verdict serve. Verdicts are not to be taken strictly like pleadings, but the court will collect the meaning of the jury, if Verdicts give such a verdict as the court can understand.” The same principle will be found decided in the case of Patterson v. The United States, 2 Wheaton, 221.
 The same doctrine is to be found, only in a stronger point of view, in Crozier v. Gano and wife, 1 Bibb, 257. And to the same effect are cases in 2 Bibb, 427 ; 3 Henning & Munford, 309; Hawks v. Crofton, 2 Burr. 698. In the case before the court, there can be no doubt as to the meaning of the jury. They have in substance found that the defendants detained the land in contest; we are therefore satisfied that this objection to the verdict ought not to be sustained. Upon a consideration of the whole case we are of opinion, that the court erred in setting aside and reversing the proceedings of the justices, and the judgment, therefore, must be reversed and the cause remanded.

We can see no reason for dismissing this suit for an error in a writ which was never served. It can only be considered as a clerical misprision, by which the defendant could not possibly be prejudiced. The alias capias which was served on the defendant is in every respect correct, and the court ought not to have looked beyond The alias capias which was served on the defendant. Reversed.

 Arch Hodge vs. Daniel Plott was as case decided on 1822-04 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. Arch Hodge vs. Daniel Plott Daniel Plott is about the following. Opinion oe the Court. — Daniel Plott recovered a judgment against William Harris, before a justice of the peace, for the sum of sixty-eight dollars and twelve cents debt, and one dollar and twelve cents costs, from which William Harris William Harris appealed to the court below, and entered into a bond with Arch Hodge, security, conditioned in substance that Plarris should prosecute Plarris appeal, and if Plott should recover more than the amount of the judgment of the justice, that said William Harris, defendant, should pay the amount of such judgment and costs of suit. the court below below rendered a judgment against William Harris for sixty-six dollars and twelve cents debt, and seven dollars and thirty-seven cents damages, but a judgment against Harris was taken against Hodge as security. Upon a judgment against Harris, execution was issued against William Harris, and at the same time a scire facias was sued out against William Harris and Hodge to show cause why execution should not issue against Harris and Hodge on the above-mentioned bond, and a judgment was rendered by the court below against Hodge for the above debt, and four dollars and ninety-five cents damages, with costs, from which Hodge appealed to the court. We are of opinion that a scire facias was improvidently issued as to Hodge, inasmuch as there was no judgment against him whereon it could rest, as by the statute there must have been, in order to entitle the plaintiff to execution. The law is, that in “ all cases of appeals or certiorari from justices of the peace, by virtue of existing laws on those subjects, if the judgment of the justice be affirmed, or judgment given on a trial upon the merits de novo in the circuit court, judgment shall be given and execution issue, not only against the original defendant or defendants in the suit before such justice, but also against his or his or security or securities in the appeal bond or bonds to prosecute such certiorari.” Acts of 1818, p. 27. Now, although the law is that judgment shall be entered against the security as well as the principal, yet it is plain that this provision being for the benefit of the plaintiff, that judgment may waive this provision, and may make that judgment election and take judgment against the principal only. This was done in this case, and afterwards an execution could not be obtained against the security as well as the principal in a summary manner by scire facias. It is a different suit and between different parties, and does not come within the purview of the statute. Besides, if there had been a joint judgment in the first instance, still the security as well as the principal would not be bound to pay until the security as well as the principal legally appeared that the principal was unable and could not pay, and nothing of this kind has been shown.

Tindall against Tindall, and upon the trial of the cause a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendant, from which the plaintiff appealed to Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. The only question presented for consideration is, whether Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas below erred in the instruction given to the jury, on motion of the defendant, which was that, “ unless it was proved that the defendant took the property out of the possession of the plaintiff unlawfully, and against the plaintiff consent, the jury must find for the defendant.” We are clearly of opinion that this instruction was erroneous. this instruction is true, that it was necessary to establish an unlawful taking from the plaintiff in order to support the action; but it was not necessary to prove the unlawful taking by the defendant. It was sufficient to prove it by any other person. This, we apprehend, is the doctrine of the common law, (1 Chitty’s PI. 185,) and by reference to the statute of this territory, (Geyer’s Digest, 333,) it is clear that the action of replevin is maintainable against any person in whose hands or possession the property may be found. We are of opinion, then, that the action of replevin lies against all persons in whose possession personal property unlawfully taken may be found, except officers of the law, who may have possession by virtue of legal process. In the opinion We have given We are supported by the authorities referred to in 1 Chitty on Pleading, 185, 186.

We are of opinion that it was error to admit such testimony.

 2. “The court erred in not permitting the defendant under the defendant plea of non-assumpsit to give evidence of payment,” We think The court did err in excluding this testimony, as payment may be given in evidence under the general issue without notice, as decided by The court, in the case of John Smith, T. v. Edmund Hogan, and as the authorities clearly establish. 1 Salk. 394 ; 6 Com. Dig. “Pleader,” E 14; 1 Ld. Raym. 217, 566; 1 Chit. Pl. 511; 12 Mod. 376. Reversed.
 2 By the common law of England, shop books are not allowed of shop books to be given in evidence for the owner. But a clerk or servant, who made the original entries may have recourse to shop books to refresh his memory, as to other written memoranda made at the time of the transaction. If the clerk or servant who made the entries be dead, shop books may be admitted in evidence to show delivery of the articles on' producing proof of his handwriting. Bull. N. P. 282; 1 Salk. 285; 2 Ld. Raym. 873; 2 Salk. 690. But if the clerk be living, though beyond the jurisdiction of the court, the entries are inadmissible. 1 Esp. 1. Where there are regular dealings between the plaintiff and defendant, and it is proved that the plaintiff keeps fair and honest books of account, and keeps no clerk, his books of account, under the circumstances and from the necessity of the case, are admissible as evidence. Vosburg v. Thayer, 12 Johns. 462; Case v. Potter, 8 Johns. 163. In other states, the suppletory oath of the plaintiff must be added. Poultney v. Ross, 1 Dall. [1 U. S.] 238; Sterrett v. Bull, 1 Bin. 234; Cogswell v. Dolliver, 2 Mass. 217; Prime v. Smith. 4 Mass. 455. In Arkansas, “the regular and fairly kept books of original entries of a deceased merchant, or regular trader, or any person keeping running accounts for goods, wares, merchandise, or other property sold or labor done, accompanied by the affidavit of the executor or administrator of such deceased person, or some creditable person for such deceased person, setting forth that they are the books, or accounts of such deceased person testator or intestate. shall be evidence to charge the defendant for the sum therein specified, subject to be repelled by other competent testimony.” Mansf. Dig. § 7. p. 499. But this is subject to this qualification, that “to entitle the party to introduce such evidence, this must first establish to the satisfaction of the court, that this testator or intestate had the reputation of keeping correct books.” Id. § 8, p. 491.
 
 Edmund F. Hogan vs. Creed Taylor was as case decided on 1822-08 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. Edmund F. Hogan vs. Creed Taylor Creed Taylor is about the following. Per Curiam.
 The judgment in case being rendered for fifty dollars more than the amount claimed in the declaration, is manifestly erroneous, and must be reversed ; case being well established, that a greater amount cannot be given than claimed in the declaration. 1 Chitty, PI. 372; Yelverton, 45; 10 Co. 117 ; 3 Com.

 Benjamin Murphy vs. Eli J. Lewis and Daniel Mooney, executors of Samuel Mosely, deceased was as case decided on 1822-08 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. Benjamin Murphy vs. Eli J. Lewis and Daniel Mooney, executors of Samuel Mosely, deceased is about the following. Opinion oe the Court. — This is a motion by the defendants to quash the execution and have the money refunded, the amount having been collected by the sheriff and paid over to the plaintiff We have no doubt the execution issued for a greater sum than the judgment authorized; for instead of six per centum as damages upon the dissolution of the injunction, the execution is for six per centum per annum, thereby making a material difference in the amount against the defendants For the defendants it has been contended, that, as the execution is erroneous, the execution ought to be quashed, and the money made thereon refunded. We are, however, of a different opinion. If the judgment had not authorized the emanation of an execution at all, or there had been no judgment, then it would be irregular to sue out one, and in such a case the doctrine contended for would be correct. But when there is only a clerical mistake in the execution, it may be corrected by the court, so as to make the court conform to the judgment. Of the power to correct errors or mistakes in executions, there can be no doubt. In the case of Smith v. Carr, Hardin, R. 308, the court of appeals of Kentucky say: “ The power of correcting the ministerial acts of the court of appeals of Kentucky own officers necessarily and incidentally belongs to every court, and has always been exercised, as well before as since the formation of the present constitution.” The case referred to was one of an erroneous execution. In the case before the court of appeals of Kentucky, to order the whole of the money to be refunded, would be more than law or justice require.
 For what purpose should we require the whole of the money to be restored ?
 That another execution might issue, and the true amount again be made and paid over to the plaintiff? We can perceive no good reason for a course of this kind, and no authority has been found to warrant no authority. We are therefore of opinion, that the mistake in the execution should be corrected, and that Murphy refund to Lewis and Mooney the amount which Mooney has received above the sum for which the execution ought to have issued. Ordered accordingly.
 
 John Wyatt, appellant, vs. Jacob Harden, appellee was as case decided on 1822-08 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. John Wyatt, appellant, vs. Jacob Harden, appellee, appellee is about the following. Opinion oe the Court. — The judgment in this case must be reversed upon two grounds: 1. the Court erred in not allowing the appellant, the defendant in the court below, until the next term to plead, after a substantial amendment of the declaration had been made. 2. the Court erred in permitting any evidence to go to the jury in relation to a ferry, as a disturbance of or injury done thereto would constitute the ground of a separate action. Reversed.
 
 William Blakely, administrator of Moses Graham, vs. Abraham Ruddell was as case decided on 1822-08 in Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. William Blakely, administrator of Moses Graham, vs. Abraham Ruddell is about the following. Opinion op Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas. — The only ground relied on for the reversal of the judgment in this action of trover is, that Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas erred in instructions to the jury. Upon the trial, on the motion of the defendant, Superior Court of the Territory of Arkansas instructed the jury that “ the plaintiff had not sustained his action by proving a demand and refusal before the commencement of the suit, the defendant having become lawfully possessed of the property.” 'There are cases where the plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves a demand and refusal, and it is equally clear that there are cases where a demand and refusal are unnecessary, although the defendant may have come lawfully into possession; as where A. lends he horse to B., and B. sells he. This would be as strong evidence of conversion as could be adduced, and no demand would be necessary to enable the plaintiff to recover. 1 Chitty, Pl. 177, 178; 5 East, 407; 6 Ib. 538; 1 Johns. Cas. 407.
